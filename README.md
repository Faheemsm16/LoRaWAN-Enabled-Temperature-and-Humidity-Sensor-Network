# LoRaWAN-Enabled-Temperature-and-Humidity-Sensor-Network

Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a LoRaWAN enabled sensor network designed to monitor temperature and humidity wirelessly. The project utilizes HTCC AB01 boards and DHT11 sensors to create a cost-effective and reliable monitoring system suitable for various industries.

Introduction
The need for real-time temperature and humidity monitoring has become increasingly important across industries such as agriculture, healthcare, logistics, and more. Inadequate monitoring can lead to losses, reduced efficiency, and risks to product quality and safety. This project addresses this need by developing a LoRaWAN enabled sensor network capable of wirelessly transmitting temperature and humidity data.

Features
Real-time Monitoring: Receive real-time temperature and humidity data wirelessly.
Scalable: The system is designed to scale according to the monitoring needs of different industries.
Cost-effective: Utilizes affordable components without compromising on reliability.
Low Power Consumption: Designed for efficient power usage, suitable for battery-operated applications.

Getting Started
To get started with the project:
Set up the hardware components including HTCC AB01 boards and DHT11 sensor.
